We created this App for [APTRI Labs,Adani Power Ahmedabad](http://www.aptri.org/) as Summer Interns    
over the summers of 19'.

It has a beautiful UI :

> Attendance Management : 

The Faculty Checks out and Checks in a trainee for a program and the app check for the following things: 

1. Whether the trainee has already checked in for today's date.
2. Whether the trainee hasn't checked in but is trying to check out.
3. Whether the trainee has already checked out and it trying to check out again. The App tells the timestamp of when he checked out.
4. Also the trainee can check in only for a particular program for a day.

All of this was done in under a week! And we used Google's Firebase real time database to ensure smooth data connectivity between users and admin.
